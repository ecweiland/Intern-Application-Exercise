The web and software development community is a community of innovators. What draws me to this is that I recognize the power of such a community to further develop skills, knowledge, and more importantly creativity. Most of my life, I wanted to become an artist. I believed that it was the creative field; that art is what creators do. This is how I discovered that when among creative people, inspiration flows much more readily than when working unaccompanied. As I progressed through high school I started branching out into the sciences. I took my first physics class and was inspired that people could come up with ways to mathematically describe the world around us. Then I started taking computer science and it showed a creative side to computers that I had never seen before. Elegant programming is truly an art, and one that I strive towards. However, elegant programming is not the only valuable skill that comes from experience in a professional computing environment. Learning new, innovative implementation techniques and pushing the boundaries of my problem solving abilities are skills I hope to gain from an internship at Hedgeye Risk Management. Further, I wish to learn how to work with a professional team to implement a project. Hedgeye Risk Managment is an optimal environment for developing these skills and presents and amazing opportunity for personal growth, and I am hopeful that I will be a good match for you.
